    <p style="padding: 10px; background-color: white;">The Huffington Post today unveiled a new version of its mobile app that lets readers record voice or video comments on stories. 



The goal is to increase readership and engagement around news stories by allowing comments in formats popular among the next generation of users, specifically the under 30-something set.



"The reality is our future readership isn't reading long form traditional news stories. They're watching videos on YouTube or, if we're lucky, commenting about news on their Facebook pages. We need to attract these users by giving them alternative ways to express themselves in the online news conversation," said HuffPo Lab Hacker Alexandra Berke, who helped develop the new feature as part of a Yahoo-Global Editors Network Hackathon in Sunnyvale.



Video is king right now as is evident in the rise of social apps such as Vine and online video sharing sites such as LiveLeak becoming popular destinations for users to showcase their creativity, but the engagement around hard news remains stuck in text-only mode.



Being able to hear and/or see another person's reactions to a news story will add context and credibility and will hopefully connect users in new ways. For example, the source of a news story could record a comment adding additional information in response to reader questions.



Video and audio comments will be limited to 20 seconds. HuffPo readers will be able to "like" video or audio comments and then sort all comments by type or popularity, making it easier to decide which to read.



While the new feature won't eliminate trolling, HuffPo thinks users who post voice or video comments immediately increase their credibility because it helps tear down a level of anonymity.



In addition to the new commenting features, mobile readers will also now be able to hear articles read aloud via an automated voice translation service or in the voice of the author.



The article reader option is a plus for those who are attached to their Smart Phones 24/7 and is another tool for attracting an audience that finds it hard to scroll through long-form articles on tiny phone screens.



"Just pop in your earphones to enjoy all your HuffPo content," Berke said, "And then listen to the audio comments as well." 



As part of the mobile app enhancements, HuffPo has added additional more prominent ad positions to help boost revenue, with hopes that the new comment and reader features will attract more advertisers.</p>
